//! This module handles game rooms where players connect and exchange messages.
//! It provides:
//! - [`Room`]: A game session with host-to-client broadcast channels
//! - [`AppState`]: Global state holding all active rooms and game configurations
//! - [`reload_config`]: Hot-reloading of game settings from `GameConfig.json`
